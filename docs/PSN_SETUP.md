### Option 1: Use Sample Data (No Setup Required)

### Option 2: Connect Real PlayStation Data

To show your actual PlayStation gaming activity, you'll need to set up PSN API access:

#### Step 1: Get PSN API Access
1. Use a community PSN API library like:
   - [psn-api](https://github.com/achievements-app/psn-api) (Node.js)
   - [psn-php](https://github.com/Ragowit/psn-php) (PHP)

#### Step 2: Get Your NPSSO Token
1. Visit [PlayStation Store](https://store.playstation.com) in your browser
2. Sign in to your PlayStation account
3. Open browser developer tools (F12)
4. Go to Application/Storage ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí https://store.playstation.com
5. Find the cookie named `npsso` and copy its value

#### Step 3: Configure Repository Secret
Add this secret to your GitHub repository:

**Secret Name:** `PSN_ACCESS`
**Secret Value:**
```json
{"npsso":"your_npsso_token_here"}
```

**To add the secret:**
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Click "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `PSN_ACCESS`
5. Value: `{"npsso":"your_actual_npsso_token"}`

#### Step 4: Manual Trigger
1. Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. Find "PlayStation Gaming Activity" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" to test

## üéØ Customization

Edit the `getGameEmoji()` function in the workflow to add custom emojis for your games.

### Update Frequency
Change the cron schedule in the workflow:
- Every 2 hours: `0 */2 * * *`
- Daily: `0 0 * * *`
- Weekly: `0 0 * * 0`
